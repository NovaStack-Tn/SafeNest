## Multi-Tenancy

All data is automatically scoped to the user's organization:
- Organization field set automatically on creation
- Queries filtered by user's organization
- Full data isolation between organizations

## Permissions

All endpoints require authentication (`IsAuthenticated`):
- Users can only access data from their organization
- CRUD operations based on user permissions
- Assignment requires appropriate role

## Frontend Integration

The Threat Intelligence page is already integrated:
- Route: `/threat-intelligence`
- Component: `ThreatIntel.tsx`
- Navigation: Already in sidebar
