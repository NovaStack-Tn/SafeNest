## 🔄 Data Flow

### **Create Threat Flow:**
1. User clicks "Add Threat" button
2. CreateThreatModal opens
3. User fills form and optionally enables AI analysis
4. On submit:
   - POST `/threat-intelligence/threats/`
   - If AI enabled: POST `/threats/{id}/ai_analyze/`
   - Invalidate queries to refresh data
   - Show success toast
5. Modal closes, threat appears in list

### **View/Edit Threat Flow:**
1. User clicks "View Details" on threat card
2. ThreatDetailModal opens with 4 tabs
3. User can:
   - Update status (calls `/threats/{id}/update_status/`)
   - Run AI analysis (calls `/threats/{id}/ai_analyze/`)
   - Generate risk assessment (calls `/threats/{id}/generate_risk_assessment/`)
